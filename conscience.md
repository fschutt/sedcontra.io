**Whether conscience is merely a construct of social surroundings?**

**Objectiones:**

1.  **Objection 1:** It seems that conscience is merely a construct of social surroundings. For, as the example suggests, practices concerning bodily covering vary greatly among different peoples. Some cultures deem nakedness acceptable, while others consider it shameful and sinful. If conscience were rooted in natural reason, which is common to all men, such significant variations regarding fundamental matters like bodily exposure would not exist. Therefore, the rules conscience dictates, particularly concerning modesty, must arise solely from custom and social agreement.
2.  **Objection 2:** Further, laws and customs within societies change over time. What was once considered immodest or scandalous can become acceptable through normalization. If society collectively decides that public nudity is permissible, the feelings of shame or guilt associated with it would diminish or disappear. This suggests that conscience merely reflects the prevailing social norms, which are mutable, rather than an immutable natural reason.
3.  **Objection 3:** Further, the education and upbringing of a child heavily influence their moral judgments. A child raised in a particular society internalizes its rules and feels guilt when transgressing them. If the same child were raised in a society with different norms (e.g., regarding nudity), their conscience would align with those norms instead. This indicates that conscience is formed by external conditioning, not by an innate deduction from reason.

**Sed Contra:**

On the contrary, the Apostle Paul writes concerning the Gentiles (Romans 2:14-15): "For when the Gentiles who do not have the law by nature observe the prescriptions of the law, they are a law for themselves even though they do not have the law. They show that the demands of the law are written in their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them." This indicates that even those without revealed law or specific societal codes possess an inner witness—conscience—attesting to a law inscribed inherently, which pertains to natural reason.

**Respondeo:**

I answer that, conscience is not *merely* a construct of social surroundings, although social factors can influence its specific applications and judgments. Conscience, properly understood, is the act of practical reason judging the morality of a particular action according to moral principles. These principles themselves are rooted, foundationally, in the natural law, which is man's participation in the eternal law of God and is knowable through natural reason.

1.  **Natural Law as Foundation:** God has instilled in human nature an inclination towards our proper end and the means to achieve it. The first principles of practical reason, grasped through the habit known as *synderesis*, are naturally known to all rational creatures (e.g., "good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided"). From these primary, self-evident principles, reason deduces more specific, secondary precepts of the natural law, which govern moral life (e.g., precepts concerning preservation of life, procreation and education of offspring, knowing the truth about God, living in society). These precepts form the objective basis upon which conscience operates.
2.  **Role of Reason:** Conscience applies these universal principles to particular situations. This application requires reasoning. While the most fundamental principles are clear, deriving and applying secondary precepts can be complex and subject to error, ignorance, or the influence of passions and customs.
3.  **Influence of Social Surroundings:** Social customs, laws, and education play a significant role in shaping the *application* of natural law principles and in determining matters that are morally indifferent or contingent. Society can help individuals understand the implications of natural law or, conversely, obscure them through corrupt customs or faulty reasoning. For example, the *principle* of modesty, which relates to the virtue of temperance and the need to avoid causing scandal or inciting lust (in oneself or others) contrary to reason, is rooted in natural law's concern for chastity and respect for the human person (body and soul). However, the *specific* determination of what constitutes modest dress can vary significantly based on climate, legitimate custom, and cultural context.
4.  **Regarding the Example of Nudity:** The observation that some cultures practice nudity does not necessarily prove that conscience is *entirely* relative.
    *   Firstly, the *meaning* and *intent* associated with nudity can differ. In some contexts, it might be practiced out of necessity (lack of resources), climate adaptation, or within a cultural framework where it does not carry the same immediate connotations of lust or disrespect as it might in another. Natural reason itself operates within specific circumstances.
    *   Secondly, even if a custom exists, it does not automatically follow that it aligns perfectly with the natural law. A society can collectively err or adopt customs that are objectively disordered, even if its members, through habituation or ignorance, cease to feel subjective guilt (i.e., their conscience becomes erroneous or lax). The normalization of a practice does not change its objective moral status if it fundamentally violates principles deducible from reason concerning human dignity, sexuality, and the common good.
    *   Thirdly, the natural law demands respect for the proper end of human sexuality and the dignity of the person. Actions that, within a given context, are likely to incite lust contrary to reason, or demonstrate a lack of respect for the body as integral to the person, would be contrary to natural reason, regardless of social normalization. Therefore, while the *specific threshold* of what constitutes immodesty can be influenced by custom, the underlying principle that actions should be ordered by reason towards virtue (like temperance and chastity) and avoid unnecessary provocation of vice remains. Normalizing nudity *could* be sinful if, in that societal context, it leads predictably to disordered desires or disrespect contrary to the objective moral order known by reason.

Therefore, conscience relies on principles known through natural reason, derived from the natural law. Social surroundings condition the application, understanding, and sometimes sadly, the corruption of these principles, but they do not create the fundamental moral law itself.

**Ad Objectiones:**

1.  **Reply to Objection 1:** Variations in customs regarding modesty demonstrate variation in the *application* or *determination* of a natural law principle within different circumstances, or potentially societal error regarding that principle. They do not negate the existence of the principle itself, which is rooted in reason's grasp of human nature and its ends (e.g., ordering sexuality according to reason, respecting persons). Natural reason dictates the end (virtue, order), while custom often influences the specific means or expressions deemed appropriate in varying contexts.
2.  **Reply to Objection 2:** Social normalization can change subjective feelings of guilt by dulling the conscience or providing faulty reasoning, but it cannot alter the objective moral reality determined by natural law. If nudity, in a given context, objectively tends towards inciting lust or showing disrespect contrary to reason, it remains disordered, even if society comes to accept it. The "is" of social acceptance does not determine the "ought" of morality rooted in nature and reason.
3.  **Reply to Objection 3:** Education and upbringing shape the *formation* of conscience, providing it with specific precepts and habits of judgment. This formation can be good, aligning conscience with true principles, or bad, leading to an erroneous conscience. This proves that conscience needs guidance and can be influenced, but it does not prove its *source* is *only* external. The capacity for practical reason and the fundamental grasp of good and evil (*synderesis*) are innate; education builds upon (or corrupts) this natural foundation. Even a poorly formed conscience still operates as an act of reason, albeit a mistaken one, applying what it *believes* (rightly or wrongly) to be the moral law.
