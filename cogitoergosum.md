**Whether "I think, therefore I am" (Cogito ergo sum) is the most suitable foundation for all knowledge?**

**Objectiones:**

1.  **Objection 1:** It seems that "I think, therefore I am" is indeed the most suitable foundation and primary certainty. For, as Augustine notes, even if one doubts, one cannot doubt that one doubts; and doubting is a form of thinking. Thus, the very act of attempting to doubt one's own existence proves it. Nothing seems more certain or undeniable than the consciousness of one's own thought, and consequently, one's own existence as a thinking thing. External senses can deceive, corporeal things can be illusions, but the act of thinking itself appears self-evident and immune to doubt.
2.  **Objection 2:** Further, knowledge must begin with certainty. If we start with objects perceived by the senses, we begin with things that are mutable and potentially deceptive, as the Academics argued. But the act of thinking is an internal act, directly known by the intellect. Therefore, beginning with the intellect's awareness of its own act ("I think") provides a more secure and certain starting point for philosophy than relying on the external world.
3.  **Objection 3:** Further, the nature of a thing is known through its operations. The primary operation we are aware of in ourselves is thinking (understanding, willing, doubting, etc.). Therefore, it seems fitting to conclude our existence ("I am") directly from this most evident operation ("I think"), making it the foundational principle.

**Sed Contra:**

On the contrary, it is written (Exodus 3:14), when Moses asked God His name, He replied, "I AM WHO AM." Thus, Being Itself (Esse) is the most fundamental reality, especially concerning the First Cause. And for creatures, their act of existing (esse) is prior, in the order of reality, to their operations (operari), such as thinking (cogitare). For a thing must first *be* in order to *act*. As Aristotle says (Metaphysics IX), act is prior to potency, and existence is the most fundamental act.

**Respondeo:**

I answer that, the proposition "I think, therefore I am," while possessing a certain undeniable truth, is not the most suitable foundation for all knowledge, nor does it properly express the primary certainty of existence in the order of reality.

1.  **Existence (Esse) is Prior to Operation (Operari):** First, we must distinguish the order of knowing (ordo cognoscendi) from the order of being (ordo essendi). While it may be true that, for an individual reflecting upon themselves, the awareness of their own thinking *activity* is a psychologically immediate and certain sign of their own existence, this does not mean that thinking *causes* or *grounds* existence. Rather, existence (esse) is the fundamental act by which any substance, including a thinking substance, *is*. Operation, such as thinking, follows upon existence. A thing operates according to its nature, but it must first *exist* to possess that nature and operate. Non-existent things do not think. Therefore, "I am" is metaphysically prior to "I think," even if the awareness of thinking leads temporally to the certain affirmation of one's existence. The "therefore" (ergo) indicates an inference in the order of our knowing, not a causal dependence in the order of being.

2.  **Knowledge Begins with the Senses:** Second, according to the Philosopher (Aristotle), all our natural knowledge originates from the senses (Nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu). While the intellect reflects upon its own act, this reflection itself depends upon prior engagement with the world through the senses. The intellect abstracts intelligible species from phantasms derived from sense experience. Even self-knowledge is not primarily achieved through a direct intuition of a "thinking substance" isolated from the world, but rather through reflecting on the intellect's acts as it knows *other* things. We know *that* we have an intellect and *that* we exist because we perceive ourselves understanding sensible objects. To make the isolated "I think" the sole foundation risks detaching the intellect from its proper object (the essences of material things) and from the very source of its content.

3.  **The Primacy of Being:** Third, the ultimate foundation of all reality and certainty is not the contingent act of created thought, but Being Itself (Ipsum Esse Subsistens), which is God. Our existence, and therefore our thinking, is a participated and contingent existence. While the awareness "I think, therefore I am" provides subjective certainty of one's own existence as a thinking being, it does not, by itself, ground the existence of anything else, nor does it lead directly to the necessary foundation of all being. The proper metaphysical starting point is the observation of beings in the world, whose existence requires a cause, leading ultimately to the affirmation of God as the First Uncaused Cause, He Who Is.

4.  **Nature of the Human Person:** Fourth, the phrase risks emphasizing the "thinking" aspect (mind) over the complete reality of the human person, who is a composite substance of body and soul (anima forma corporis). While thinking is a proper operation of the rational soul, human existence is not reducible solely to thinking. Our being is that of an embodied soul. To begin *only* with "I think" can lead towards an excessive dualism, separating mind from body, which is contrary to the integrated view of the human person. Our existence is not merely *res cogitans* (a thinking thing), but a subsistent individual of a rational nature, composed of form (soul) and matter (body).

Therefore, while the connection between thinking and being affirmed in the *Cogito* is true (one who thinks, necessarily exists), it represents a truth discovered through reflection upon an operation, rather than the fundamental metaphysical principle. Existence (esse) is primary, derived ultimately from God, and our knowledge naturally begins with the sensible world which leads us to understand both ourselves and our Creator.

**Ad Objectiones:**

1.  **Reply to Objection 1:** The certainty derived from "I think, therefore I am" is a psychological certainty about one's own present existence *as* thinking. It is true that doubting proves the existence of the doubter. However, this certainty is about the *act* and the *subject* performing the act *hic et nunc* (here and now). It does not establish the *nature* of that subject comprehensively (e.g., as an embodied soul), nor does it serve as the *metaphysical foundation* of being, which is *esse* itself, received from God. Furthermore, self-knowledge is perfected not in isolation, but through the soul's acts directed towards external objects.
2.  **Reply to Objection 2:** While internal acts have a certain immediacy, knowledge cannot remain purely internal if it is to grasp reality. The senses, though occasionally mistaken about particulars, are fundamentally ordered towards truth and are the necessary gateways for the intellect to receive data about the world, from which it abstracts universal truths. To reject the senses as a starting point based on the *possibility* of deception is to cut off the natural root of human knowledge and risks falling into solipsism. Reason itself can correct sensory errors, but it needs sensory input to have content about the created world. The certainty of the *Cogito* is narrow; the certainty derived from sensible reality, leading via reason to God, is broader and more metaphysically grounded.
3.  **Reply to Objection 3:** It is true that we know natures through operations. However, thinking is not the *only* operation of the human person; there are also vegetative and sensitive operations tied to our embodied existence. More importantly, the operation (thinking) presupposes the existence of the operator. Thus, while knowing the operation helps us understand the operator and affirm its existence, the existence itself remains ontologically prior. The conclusion "I am" is known *through* the awareness of "I think," but the "am" is the foundation for the possibility of the "think."
