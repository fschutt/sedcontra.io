**Whether "I think, therefore I am" is the most suitable foundation for all knowledge?**

**Objectiones:**

1.  **Objection 1:** It seems that "I think, therefore I am" (Cogito ergo sum) is indeed the most suitable foundation and primary certainty. For, as Augustine argues in *Contra Academicos* and elsewhere, even if one doubts all else, the very act of doubting confirms the existence of the doubter as a thinking entity. This internal awareness of thought seems impervious to the deceptions that might affect sense perception, providing an apodictic starting point for knowledge.
2.  **Objection 2:** Further, philosophy must begin with indubitable certainty to avoid skepticism. Sensory experience is notoriously fallible, concerning particulars and subject to illusion. Thought, however, especially the reflexive awareness of thinking itself, appears directly and immediately known by the intellect without sensory mediation. Therefore, basing knowledge on this internal certainty ("I think") seems more secure than starting with the potentially unreliable external world.
3.  **Objection 3:** Further, knowledge pertains to the intelligible nature of things, and the primary operation through which we grasp intelligibility is thinking. Since operation follows upon being and reveals nature (*operari sequitur esse*), the immediate awareness of our primary operation (thinking) provides the most direct route to affirming our own existence as the necessary subject of that operation. Thus, it seems the most fitting foundation.

**Sed Contra:**

On the contrary, First Philosophy or Metaphysics, as Aristotle explains (*Metaphysics* IV.1), takes *being qua being* as its subject. The ultimate principles of reality and knowledge pertain to being itself. Furthermore, operation presupposes existence; for something to act (e.g., to think), it must first *be*. Existence (esse) is the most fundamental actuality of any substance, prior to any specific operation. Therefore, the proper starting point for metaphysics, and ultimately all grounded knowledge, must concern being itself, not merely the act of thinking.

**Respondeo:**

I answer that, the proposition "I think, therefore I am," while expressing a psychologically immediate certainty for the thinking subject, is not the most suitable *philosophical* foundation for all knowledge, nor does it accurately reflect the metaphysical priority.

1.  **Metaphysical Priority of Existence (Esse) over Operation (Operari):** We must distinguish the order of discovery or psychological awareness (*ordo cognoscendi*) from the order of reality or being (*ordo essendi*). While the *awareness* of thinking might be the first point of subjective certainty for someone engaging in methodical doubt, this does not entail that thinking is metaphysically primary. In reality, for any finite substance, its act of existing (*esse*) is logically and ontologically prior to its operations (*operari*). A thing must first possess existence before it can exercise any power or perform any act, including thinking. Thinking is an act of an existing being; non-being does not think. The "therefore" (*ergo*) in the *Cogito* signifies a valid inference *within the order of knowing* (I know I exist *because* I catch myself thinking), but it reverses the *order of being* where existence grounds the possibility of thought.
2.  **Origin of Knowledge in Sensory Experience:** According to sound philosophy following Aristotle, all human knowledge, including self-knowledge, originates ultimately from sensory experience. The intellect abstracts intelligible forms (*species intelligibiles*) from the images (*phantasmata*) provided by the senses. Even the intellect's reflection upon itself and its act of thinking presupposes prior acts of understanding directed towards objects initially encountered through the senses. We come to know *that* we have an intellect and *that* we exist as thinking beings principally by experiencing ourselves performing acts of understanding upon sensible objects. To make the isolated awareness of "thinking" the absolute foundation risks detaching the intellect from its proper object (the essences of sensible things) and the necessary empirical grounding of all its content, potentially leading towards idealism or solipsism.
3.  **The Foundational Role of Being and First Principles:** The ultimate foundation of knowledge lies not in the contingent act of individual thought, but in the principles of being itself, knowable by the intellect. These include self-evident first principles like the principle of non-contradiction (a thing cannot both be and not be in the same respect at the same time), which governs all thought and reality. Metaphysics proceeds from the study of *being* in the world, analyzing concepts like substance, potency and act, cause and effect. This investigation, grounded in experience and reason, leads to the affirmation of a First Uncaused Cause or Pure Actuality (ipsum Esse per se subsistens) as the ultimate ground of all contingent existence and intelligibility – a conclusion reached through reason, not merely subjective certainty. The *Cogito* provides certainty only of the self as a thinking substance *here and now*, but does not, by itself, ground knowledge of other existents or the ultimate principles of reality.
4.  **Understanding the Human Knower:** Starting solely with "I think" tends to define the human person primarily as *res cogitans* (a thinking thing), potentially neglecting the essential unity of the human composite – an embodied rational soul. Philosophical anthropology, grounded in observation and reason, recognizes man as a substance composed of matter (body) and form (rational soul). Our thinking is the act of an embodied intellect, dependent on sensory input. Isolating the "I think" risks an artificial dualism between mind and body, inadequately representing the nature of the human knower and thinker.

Therefore, while the *Cogito* offers a powerful point of subjective certainty against radical doubt, it is not the proper *metaphysical* foundation for knowledge. The primary object of the intellect is being, knowledge begins fundamentally with sense experience, and the ultimate ground of reality and knowledge is Being itself and its first principles, knowable through reason's engagement with the world.

**Ad Objectiones:**

1.  **Reply to Objection 1:** The certainty identified by Augustine and Descartes is undeniable *as* subjective evidence for the existence of the thinker *while thinking*. However, this psychological starting point does not equate to the *ontological* or *epistemological* foundation of all reality and knowledge. It confirms the existence of a contingent, thinking subject, but does not establish the nature of that subject fully or the principles governing reality beyond the self. Furthermore, as argued in the Respondeo, even this self-awareness relies indirectly on prior engagement with the world.
2.  **Reply to Objection 2:** While sensory particulars can be deceptive, this does not invalidate the senses as the necessary *origin* of intellectual content. Reason possesses the capacity to judge, compare, and correct sensory information, and to abstract universal, necessary truths that transcend sensory fallibility. Rejecting the senses entirely based on potential error leads to an impoverished epistemology, unable to account for knowledge of the external world or even provide content for thought itself. The certainty of the *Cogito* is arguably too narrow and internal to serve as a foundation for *all* knowledge, including knowledge of the external world.
3.  **Reply to Objection 3:** While we know natures through operations, this knowledge is comprehensive only when considering *all* relevant operations within their proper context. Focusing solely on thinking neglects other essential human operations (vegetative, sensitive) and, more importantly, ignores the metaphysical principle that existence (*esse*) is the prior actuality enabling any operation whatsoever. We affirm existence *through* the act of thinking, but existence itself remains the fundamental ground.
