**Whether Catholics may licitly receive Sacraments administered according to the Novus Ordo rites?**

Note: The following is an answer generated from a transcript of [The Problems of the Novus Ordo Sacraments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=No4Nj8duyRY) by Fr. Hesse, an experienced Canon lawyer.

**Objection 1:** It seems that Catholics may receive Novus Ordo sacraments. For these rites were promulgated by Popes Paul VI and John Paul II, who held the supreme authority in the Church. Obedience to the Pope, as argued previously, requires acceptance of his liturgical disciplines.

**Objection 2:** Further, one may concede the *validity* of certain Novus Ordo sacraments under specific conditions (e.g., Latin Mass with Roman Canon, Ordinations performed correctly by a valid Bishop, Baptism with correct form and matter). If a sacrament is valid, it confers grace, and thus should be accessible to the faithful.

**Objection 3:** Further, the vast majority of Catholics worldwide only have access to Novus Ordo sacraments. To declare them illicit or forbidden would seem to deprive most of the faithful of the means of grace, which contradicts the Church's maternal solicitude.

**On the Contrary,** Blessed Pope Innocent XI condemned the proposition: "It is not illicit in conferring sacraments, to follow a probable opinion regarding the value of the sacrament, the safer opinion being abandoned..." (Denzinger-Sch√∂nmetzer 2101). Therefore, the Novus Ordo Mass in the vernacular is, at best, gravely doubtful and most likely invalid due to the change in the words of consecration ("for all" instead of "for many") constituting a change in significance, which according to the Church's own pre-conciliar principles (cf. *De Defectibus* in the Roman Missal) invalidates the sacrament. Furthermore, he classified the entire Novus Ordo system as a "schismatic rite," born from a rupture with Tradition implicitly condemned by the Council of Trent (Session VII, Canon 13) and St. Pius V's Bull *Quo Primum*. Participation in doubtful sacraments is forbidden, and participation in even valid but illicit or schismatic rites is objectively problematic and harmful to the Faith.

**I Answer That,** while acknowledging the complexities and careful distinctions regarding *validity*, the question of *liceity* (lawfulness) and *prudence* in receiving Novus Ordo sacraments must be addressed according to his principles.

1.  **The Principle of Avoiding Doubtful Sacraments:** Given Blessed Innocent XI's condemnation, if a sacrament's validity is reasonably doubtful, Catholics are morally obliged to refrain from participating in it. Rooted in traditional sacramental theology and the Church's own rubrical directives (*De Defectibus*), the Novus Ordo Mass *in the vernacular* is gravely doubtful regarding the consecration of the wine, and therefore likely invalid altogether due to the impossibility of consecrating outside of a true Mass (defect of intention). Consequently, based on this principle alone, attendance at the Novus Ordo vernacular Mass is morally illicit.

2.  **The Problem of the "Schismatic Rite":** The Novus Ordo, as a whole, represents a break from the continuous liturgical tradition of the Roman Rite, enacted against the spirit and letter of Trent and *Quo Primum*. It may be termed a "schismatic rite," not necessarily implying formal schism by all adherents, but signifying a *de facto* separation from the established, protected liturgical tradition of the Church. Participating habitually in such a rite, even in its potentially *valid* instances (like a carefully celebrated Latin Novus Ordo), lends legitimacy to this rupture and exposes the faithful to the weakened and often ambiguous expression of the Faith embedded within the new rites. It normalizes the revolution.

3.  **Validity vs. Liceity and Prudence:** While acknowledging the likely validity of ordinations performed according to the new rite (judging them by the standards applied to Eastern or historically separated groups, not by *Sacramentum Ordinis* which applies only to the traditional Roman Rite), this validity does not automatically make participation licit or prudent. The ordination occurs *within* the context of the problematic new system. Similarly, while a Latin Novus Ordo Mass might be valid, it is still part of the rite that displaced the traditional liturgy and embodies different theological emphases. Prudence dictates seeking the surest and most traditional expression of the Faith.

4.  **Specific Sacraments:**
    *   **Mass (Vernacular):** Illicit due to grave doubt regarding validity. *Avoid.*
    *   **Mass (Latin):** Though likely valid if done correctly, it remains part of the illicit "schismatic rite." Active participation should be avoided if the Traditional Latin Mass is available. Attending passively out of necessity (e.g., a funeral where no traditional option exists) might be tolerated, but habitual attendance is discouraged.
    *   **Ordination:** One should not seek ordination within this rite. Recognizing the validity of those already ordained is necessary for identifying true priests, but doesn't endorse the rite itself.
    *   **Baptism:** Usually valid if matter/form correct. However, given the often-deficient catechesis and ceremonies surrounding it, seeking baptism in the traditional rite is strongly preferred.
    *   **Confirmation/Extreme Unction:** Doubtful or invalid if improper matter (non-olive oil) is used. Avoid unless certainty about matter and form exists.
    *   **Confession:** Validity relies on jurisdiction (which the Church supplies in necessity/doubt/common error, even for traditional priests). While Novus Ordo priests with faculties likely confess validly, the overall context makes seeking confession from a traditional priest preferable.
    *   **Marriage:** Generally considered valid due to the Church's protection of this sacrament, though seeking it within the traditional framework is ideal.

Therefore, Catholics seeking to remain faithful to Tradition should avoid the Novus Ordo vernacular Mass due to grave doubts about its validity. They should also, out of fidelity to the traditional Roman Rite and prudence, avoid habitual participation in any Novus Ordo sacraments, even potentially valid ones, whenever the traditional sacraments administered by priests faithful to Tradition are accessible. The priority is to adhere to the received and approved rites of the Church which safely transmit the Faith, untainted by ambiguity or rupture.

**Reply to Objection 1:** Papal authority does not extend to imposing doubtful sacraments or rites that harm the Faith or break significantly with venerable Tradition (as argued by Trent and Innocent III). The promulgation of the Novus Ordo is precisely the point of contention, seen by Hesse as an abuse of authority implicitly warned against by previous magisterial acts.

**Reply to Objection 2:** Validity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for licit reception. A sacrament can be valid but illicit (e.g., Mass by a suspended priest, or sacraments in a schismatic rite). Furthermore, the condemnation of approaching *doubtful* sacraments overrides considerations of potential validity in cases like the vernacular Novus Ordo Mass.

**Reply to Objection 3:** The current crisis, where the majority may only have access to problematic rites, highlights the severity of the situation, not the legitimacy of the Novus Ordo. God's providence ensures the *true* Faith and sacraments remain accessible through the faithful remnant adhering to Tradition. The obligation is to seek out these sure means, not to justify participation in questionable rites due to their prevalence. The Church's maternal solicitude is found in preserving the integrity of the Faith and Sacraments, even if only for a few, rather than offering potentially compromised rites to many.
