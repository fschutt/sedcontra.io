            <h2>Our Method: Techno-Scholastic Disputation</h2>

            <p>The articles on this site follow a structure inspired by the scholastic method, particularly as used by St. Thomas Aquinas in his <em>Summa Theologiae</em>. This method promotes clarity, thoroughness, and direct engagement with counterarguments. Each article typically includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objectiones (Objections):</strong> Plausible arguments against the position the author will ultimately defend. We often aim for the "double objection" style where multiple strong counterpoints are presented.</li>
                <li><strong>Sed Contra (On the Contrary):</strong> A brief statement or authority pointing towards the author's position. (In our rational focus, this might be a philosophical principle rather than Scripture).</li>
                <li><strong>Respondeo (I Answer That):</strong> The core argument and explanation of the author's position, grounded in reason.</li>
                <li><strong>Ad Objectiones (Reply to Objections):</strong> Specific responses addressing each of the initial objections.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This structured approach forces a clear articulation of the question, anticipates difficulties, and provides a reasoned defense. </p>

            <h2>Contributing to the Disputation: Submission Guidelines</h2>

            <p>We welcome contributions that adhere to the spirit and method of this site. If you wish to submit a question explored via AI, please follow these guidelines carefully:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>AI Generation Required:</strong> The <em>entire</em> dialectic submitted – the framing of the question, the Objectiones, Sed Contra, Respondeo, and Ad Objectiones – must be generated by an Artificial Intelligence (like GPT-4, Claude, etc.). Specify the AI model used if possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Include Original Prompt(s):</strong> You MUST include the exact initial prompt(s) you used to generate the question and the subsequent scholastic-style response. This provides essential context about the AI's starting point.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>"Double Objection" Style:</strong> The AI should be prompted to generate at least two distinct and plausible objections (Objectiones) to the position it will ultimately argue for in the Respondeo.
                 </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Include Follow-Up Arguments:</strong> If your interaction with the AI included relevant follow-up questions and answers that refine or challenge the initial article, please include that entire exchange as part of the submission.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Markdown Format Only:</strong> Submissions must be provided as plain text Markdown files (`.md`). Please use standard Markdown syntax for structure (headings, lists, bold/italics).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Focus on Reason (Crucial):</strong> This site prioritizes arguments appealing to natural reason, logic, observation, and philosophical principles. While exploring AI's capacity to engage with theological concepts is interesting, submissions should strive to have the core argument (especially the <em>Respondeo</em>) stand on rational grounds.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Avoid making specific Scriptural verses or points of dogma the <em>necessary premise or primary justification</em> for the main argument.</li>
                        <li>References to Scripture or dogma can be included within objections, discussed historically, or noted as congruent with reason, but the goal is rational persuasion accessible to those who may not accept revealed authority.</li>
                        <li>Think: "How would Aquinas argue this point in the <em>Summa Contra Gentiles</em> for an audience unfamiliar with the Bible?"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Why These Rules?</h3>
            <p>These guidelines ensure consistency in format and philosophical approach. They also allow the site to serve as an interesting repository exploring how current AI models handle structured philosophical reasoning and debate, particularly when guided towards rational rather than purely authoritative arguments.</p>
