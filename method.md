We welcome contributions [here](https://github.com/fschutt/sedcontra.io/issues) that adhere to the spirit 
and method of this site, particularly those exploring the capabilities of AI in philosophical discourse.

### Format

The articles follow a structure inspired by the scholastic method used by Aquinas:

*   **Objectiones - Objections:** Plausible arguments against the position the author will ultimately defend.
*   **Sed Contra - On the Contrary:** A brief statement or principle pointing towards the author's position.
*   **Respondeo - I Answer That:** The core argument and explanation of the author's position, grounded in reason.
*   **Ad Objectiones - Reply to Objections:** Specific responses addressing each of the initial objections.

This structured approach forces a clear articulation of the question, 
anticipates difficulties, and provides a reasoned defense.

#### Submission Guidelines

If you wish to submit a question explored via AI, please follow these guidelines carefully:

1.  **AI Generation Required:** The _entire_ dialectic submitted – the framing of the question, the Objectiones, Sed Contra, Respondeo, and Ad Objectiones – must be generated by an Artificial Intelligence (like GPT-4, Claude, etc.). Please specify the AI model used if possible.
2.  **Include Original Prompt(s):** You **MUST** include the exact initial prompt(s) you used to generate the question and the subsequent scholastic-style response. This provides essential context.
3.  **Respect Format:** The AI should be prompted to generate at least **two** distinct and plausible objections (Objectiones) to the position it will ultimately argue for in the Respondeo.
4.  **Include Follow-Up Arguments:** If your interaction with the AI included relevant follow-up questions and answers that refine or challenge the initial article, please include that entire exchange as part of the submission.
5.  **Markdown Format Only:** Submissions must be provided as plain text **Markdown** files (`.md`). Use standard Markdown syntax.
6.  **Reason over Dogma:** This site prioritizes arguments appealing to **natural reason**, logic, observation, and philosophical principles. Submissions should strive to have the core argument (especially the _Respondeo_) stand on rational grounds.
    *   Avoid making specific Scriptural verses or points of dogma the _necessary premise or primary justification_ for the main argument.
    *   References to Scripture or dogma can be included within objections, discussed historically, or noted as congruent with reason, but the goal is **rational persuasion** accessible to those who may not accept divine authority.
    *   Think: "How would Aquinas argue this point in the _Summa Contra Gentiles_ for an audience potentially unfamiliar with revelation?"
