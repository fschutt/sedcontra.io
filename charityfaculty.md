**Whether Charity constitutes a third faculty of the rational soul?**

**Objectiones (Objections):**

1.  **Objection 1:** It seems that Charity (or Love) is a third faculty. For the human soul is made in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26-27), and God is a Trinity of Persons. It stands to reason, therefore, that the highest powers of the soul reflecting this image would also be three in number. Since Intellect and Will are commonly accepted as the two principal rational faculties, a third faculty, Love or Charity, corresponding perhaps to the Holy Spirit (who is Love), seems fitting to complete the analogy.
2.  **Objection 2:** Further, love seems distinct from both knowing and willing as commonly understood. As the example suggests, one can know food (Intellect) and will to eat it for sustenance (Will seeking a perceived good), yet this does not capture the distinct experience of *loving* the food, savoring its qualities, which seems tied to an appreciation of its goodness or *beauty* in a way not fully reducible to mere intellectual apprehension or volitional desire for utility. The expression "to love with all one's heart" seems to point to a central affective power distinct from calculating intellect or purposeful will.
3.  **Objection 3:** Further, Beauty appears to be a distinct transcendental property of being, alongside Truth and Goodness. Since Truth is the proper object of the Intellect, and Goodness is the proper object of the Will, it seems reasonable that Beauty should be the proper object of a distinct, third faculty, which we might call Love or the appreciative faculty. For beauty evokes a response – delight, love, admiration – that seems different in kind from mere understanding (Intellect) or desire/choice (Will).

**Sed Contra (On the Contrary):**

On the contrary, Boethius states (De Consol. i), "Thou dost rule the world with Reason," and the Philosopher (Aristotle) places the moving principle of the soul in the intellect and the appetite (which in rational beings is the will) (De Anima iii, 10). The primary operations distinguishing the rational soul are understanding and willing (or loving what is understood as good). Furthermore, St. Thomas teaches that love (*amor*) is the primary act of the appetitive power (including the will) regarding a good (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 26, a. 1). It does not require a distinct faculty but is the will's initial response to the good apprehended by the intellect.

**Respondeo (I Answer That):**

I answer that, Love, whether natural or the supernatural virtue of Charity, is not a distinct faculty or power of the soul equivalent to Intellect and Will. Rather, love is fundamentally an *act* or *movement* of the appetitive power, which in the rational soul is the Will.

1.  **Faculties Distinguished by Objects and Acts:** The powers or faculties of the soul are distinguished according to their proper acts and proper objects. The Intellect is the power whose act is understanding and whose object is Truth (being as intelligible). The Will is the power whose act is willing (inclining towards, choosing, loving) and whose object is Goodness (being as desirable, as apprehended by the intellect). All operations of the rational soul can be reduced to these two fundamental powers: knowing and tending/appetizing.
2.  **Love as an Act of the Will:** Love (*amor*) is the first movement of the will (or any appetite) in response to a perceived good. It is the initial complacency or affinity the will feels towards something apprehended by the intellect as good. From this initial love arise other movements like desire (if the good is absent), joy (if the good is possessed), choice (selecting means to attain the good), etc. Therefore, love is not a separate power but a primary *function* of the existing power of the Will. Supernatural Charity is this same power of the will elevated by grace to love God for His own sake above all things, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God.
3.  **The Imago Dei:** The soul's image of the Trinity does not necessarily demand a strict one-to-one correspondence of three faculties to the three Divine Persons. The *imago Dei* resides chiefly in the rational soul's capacity for self-reflective knowledge (Intellect knowing itself and its object) and self-directed love (Will loving the good known), which mirrors, albeit imperfectly, the inner Trinitarian life of God knowing and loving Himself. This dynamic interplay of Intellect and Will suffices for the analogy. St. Augustine's analogy of memory, understanding, and will is one way to explore this, but even there, memory is often understood not as a wholly separate faculty but related to the intellect's retention of species.
4.  **Beauty, Intellect, and Will:** Beauty is indeed related to Truth and Goodness. Aquinas defines the beautiful as "that which pleases upon being seen" (*id quod visum placet*, S.T. I, q. 5, a. 4, ad 1). The "seeing" (visum) implies cognitive apprehension, primarily by the Intellect (or senses guided by intellect), which grasps the object's integrity, proportion, and clarity. The "pleasing" (*placet*) refers to the delight or complacency experienced by the Will (or sensitive appetite) in response to this apprehension of harmonious form. Thus, the appreciation of beauty is not the act of a third faculty, but rather a complex act involving *both* the Intellect apprehending the objective qualities that constitute beauty (a kind of truth or formal goodness) *and* the Will responding with delight or love to that apprehended perfection (as a good).
5.  **"Love with all my Heart":** This common expression is understood metaphorically to mean loving with the entirety of one's being, engaging all one's affections and volitions, centered in the will but drawing upon the full range of human powers (including sensitive affections), rather than indicating a distinct psychological faculty called "heart" or "love".

Therefore, while love is central to the soul's life and perfection (especially supernatural Charity), it finds its proper place as the foundational act of the Will, oriented towards the Good apprehended by the Intellect. There is no need to posit a third distinct rational faculty.

**Ad Objectiones (Reply to Objections):**

1.  **Reply to Objection 1:** The *imago Dei* is sufficiently reflected in the soul's capacity to know and love through Intellect and Will, mirroring the Trinitarian life without requiring a strict numerical faculty correspondence. The operations themselves provide the analogy.
2.  **Reply to Objection 2:** The difference between merely willing food for sustenance and *loving* it involves the manner in which the good is apprehended and the consequent response of the appetite. Loving food involves apprehending not just its utility but its inherent sensory goodness (beauty, taste, etc.) via the senses and intellect, leading to a stronger affective response (delight, pleasure) in the sensitive appetite and the will. This richness of experience stems from the interplay of different powers (senses, intellect, sensitive appetite, will) responding to different aspects of the object's goodness, not from a distinct "love" faculty. Supernatural love (Charity) perfects the will's act, directing it towards the highest Good, God.
3.  **Reply to Objection 3:** Beauty is not the object of a distinct faculty but is apprehended by the cognitive powers (Intellect primarily, but also senses) due to its formal characteristics (integrity, proportion, clarity), and it delights the appetitive power (Will) precisely because this well-formed being is perceived as good and desirable in itself. The experience of beauty is thus a harmonious operation of knowing and loving (willing/delighting), not an operation of a third power.
