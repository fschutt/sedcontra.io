Welcome to sedcontra.io: Here we try to use AI in order to answer common objections to 
atheist / agnostic questions. The goal is to create more interest in traditional Catholic and 
Greek philosophy, especially for non-Catholics without relying on divine revelation (as agnostics 
wouldn't accept that). While the authors are not alive anymore, we now have AI to explore what 
they "would have thought" based on their principles and even let them "digitally refute" 
modernist philosophers that came after their death. 

If you have a "good question" or a "gotcha", you can 
[add it here on GitHub](https://github.com/fschutt/sedcontra.io/issues).
Please see [the rules](/rules) for Submission rules. Note that it 
has to be an actual good question.
