Welcome to sedcontra.io: An AI-assisted battleground between St. Thomas Aquinas, Buddha, Plato, Confucius, Kant, 
Adorno, Rahner and Aristoteles are duking it out in a techno-scholastic question-answer style,
generated by AI (Gemini-2.5 Thinking). The goal is to create more interest in traditional Catholic 
and Greek philosophy: while the authors are not alive anymore, we now have AI to simulate what they 
"would have thought" concerning philosophers that came after their death. 

The site is not entirely serious and is more of a hobby project to re-discover medieval scholasticism 
from a modern perspective via AI-generated dialectics. The site was prompted by me debating my grandmother 
on Thomism and then writing down her objections and seeing if I can get any reasonable answers that don't 
presume any dogmas.

Ultimately, this site is written for atheists and agnostics, as they often want to "make the world a better place",
but only focus on the material, emotional or political aspect, not the underlying philosophy, that will sooner or later
make itself apparent in the actions and life choices of the people.

_So, what is the end goal of man?_
