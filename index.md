## Welcome to the Disputation

Welcome to sedcontra.io, an experiment in structured thought and dialogue. Inspired by the rigor of scholastic philosophy, particularly the methods of St. Thomas Aquinas, this project aims to explore enduring philosophical questions and contemporary challenges through the lens of rational inquiry.

Using the clarity of the scholastic method, sometimes explored via AI-generated dialectics, we seek not necessarily final answers, but deeper understanding, clearer formulation of problems, and a robust examination of the arguments surrounding life's most important questions.

Ultimately, this structured inquiry leads us back to the most fundamental query concerning our own existence and direction.

_So, what do you think is the end goal of man?_

## About sedcontra.io

The name **"sedcontra.io"** reflects the core of this project. _"Sed contra..."_ ("On the contrary...") is the pivotal phrase in St. Thomas Aquinas's scholastic method, signaling the turn from objections to the author's own reasoned position. It embodies rigorous engagement with opposing viewpoints. The ".io" domain nods to the contemporary, technological context in which we explore these enduring questions.

### Summa Contra Gentiles 2.0

Aquinas's _Summa Contra Gentiles_ was written to explain and defend the Christian faith using arguments grounded primarily in **reason**, intended for dialogue with those who did not accept the authority of Christian scripture. This site aims to be a **"Summa Contra Gentiles 2.0"** – an attempt to apply a similar rigor and rational focus to both timeless philosophical questions and contemporary challenges arising from science, technology, and modern philosophy.

### Focus on Reason

While inspired by the Thomistic tradition, the primary tool employed here is **natural reason**. The goal is to structure arguments and explore questions in a way that appeals to logic, observation, and philosophical principles accessible to anyone, regardless of their faith background. We aim to see how far reason can take us in understanding reality, human nature, and our ultimate purpose. This approach is intentionally chosen to foster dialogue with atheists, agnostics, and seekers of all kinds who prioritize rational inquiry.

## Structure

The questions are typically organized into sections, moving generally from foundational principles towards more complex applications:

*   **I. Fundamenta:** Basic Principles (Logic, Metaphysics, Epistemology)
*   **II. De Homine:** On the Human Person (Soul, Intellect, Will, Freedom, Natural Law)
*   **III. De Deo et Fine Ultimo:** On God and the Final End (Existence of God, Attributes, Purpose)
*   **IV. Disputationes:** Contra Philosophos Modernos (Engagements with thinkers like Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, etc.)
*   **V. Quaestiones Non Seriae:** Less Formal Questions (Thought experiments, hypotheticals)

*(Note: On the conceptual website, these sections might be color-coded for clarity).*

## Our Method: Techno-Scholastic Disputation

The articles follow a structure inspired by the scholastic method used by Aquinas:

*   **Objectiones (Objections):** Plausible arguments against the position the author will ultimately defend. We often aim for the "double objection" style where multiple strong counterpoints are presented.
*   **Sed Contra (On the Contrary):** A brief statement or principle pointing towards the author's position (often a philosophical principle in our context).
*   **Respondeo (I Answer That):** The core argument and explanation of the author's position, grounded in reason.
*   **Ad Objectiones (Reply to Objections):** Specific responses addressing each of the initial objections.

This structured approach forces a clear articulation of the question, anticipates difficulties, and provides a reasoned defense.

## Contributing to the Disputation

We welcome contributions that adhere to the spirit and method of this site, particularly those exploring the capabilities of AI in philosophical discourse.

### Submission Guidelines

If you wish to submit a question explored via AI, please follow these guidelines carefully:

1.  **AI Generation Required:** The _entire_ dialectic submitted – the framing of the question, the Objectiones, Sed Contra, Respondeo, and Ad Objectiones – must be generated by an Artificial Intelligence (like GPT-4, Claude, etc.). Please specify the AI model used if possible.
2.  **Include Original Prompt(s):** You **MUST** include the exact initial prompt(s) you used to generate the question and the subsequent scholastic-style response. This provides essential context.
3.  **"Double Objection" Style:** The AI should be prompted to generate at least **two** distinct and plausible objections (Objectiones) to the position it will ultimately argue for in the Respondeo.
4.  **Include Follow-Up Arguments:** If your interaction with the AI included relevant follow-up questions and answers that refine or challenge the initial article, please include that entire exchange as part of the submission.
5.  **Markdown Format Only:** Submissions must be provided as plain text **Markdown** files (`.md`). Use standard Markdown syntax.
6.  **Focus on Reason (Crucial):** This site prioritizes arguments appealing to **natural reason**, logic, observation, and philosophical principles. Submissions should strive to have the core argument (especially the _Respondeo_) stand on rational grounds.
    *   Avoid making specific Scriptural verses or points of dogma the _necessary premise or primary justification_ for the main argument.
    *   References to Scripture or dogma can be included within objections, discussed historically, or noted as congruent with reason, but the goal is **rational persuasion** accessible to those who may not accept revealed authority.
    *   Think: "How would Aquinas argue this point in the _Summa Contra Gentiles_ for an audience potentially unfamiliar with revelation?"

### Why These Rules?

These guidelines ensure consistency in format and philosophical approach. They also allow the site to serve as an interesting repository exploring how current AI models handle structured philosophical reasoning and debate, particularly when guided towards rational rather than purely authoritative arguments.

### How to Submit

Please email your complete submission (including AI model used, prompt(s), generated text in Markdown, and any follow-up dialogue) to:

**submissions [at] sedcontra [dot] io**
_(Format the email address correctly)_

Use a subject line like: `Submission: [Your Question Title]`

### Please Note

All submissions will be reviewed for suitability, adherence to the guidelines, and quality of the generated content. We reserve the right to edit submissions for clarity, formatting, or brevity, and to decline publication. We will endeavor to credit the submitter (unless anonymity is requested), but publication is not guaranteed. Thank you for your interest in contributing!
