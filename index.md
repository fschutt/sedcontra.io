Welcome to sedcontra.io: In an AI-assisted battle, St. Thomas Aquinas, Buddha, Plato, Confucius, Kant, 
St. Augustine, Adorno, Rahner and Aristoteles are duking it out in a techno-scholastic question-answer 
style, generated by AI (Gemini-2.5 Thinking). The goal is to create more interest in traditional Catholic 
and Greek philosophy, especially without "dogma" (i.e. not appealing to "scripture says"). 
While the authors are not alive anymore, we now have AI to explore what they "would have thought" concerning 
philosophers that came after their death. 

If you have a "good question" or a "gotcha", you can [add it here on GitHub](https://github.com/fschutt/sedcontra.io/issues).
Please see [rules.md]() for Submission rules. It has to be an actual good (or meme-worthy, in the non-serious
case) question.

The site is not entirely serious and is more of a hobby project to re-discover medieval scholasticism 
from a modern perspective via AI-generated dialectics. The site was prompted by me debating my grandmother 
on Thomism and then writing down her objections and seeing if I can get any reasonable answers and then
discovering that most traditional priests are too busy to discuss these things at length and my ADHD 
TikTok-rotted brain cannot handle Tertullian and Boethius, so I turned to vibe-philosophizing via AI slop,
as I discovered Gemini to be quite good at reasoning about Thomistic principles.

Ultimately, this site is written for atheists and agnostics, as they often want to "make the world 
a better place" but only focus on the material or political aspect, not the underlying philosophy, 
that will sooner or later make itself manifest in the actions and life choices of the people. Good or bad
philosophy is the best, quickest and most efficient way to do that, sadly you rarely see people 
debating philosophy, only politics, which is annoying.

_So, what is the end goal of man?_
