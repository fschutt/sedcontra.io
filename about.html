            <h2>About sedcontra.io</h2>

            <p>The name "sedcontra.io" reflects the core of this project. <em>"Sed contra..."</em> ("On the contrary...") is the pivotal phrase in St. Thomas Aquinas's scholastic method, signaling the turn from objections to the author's own reasoned position. It embodies rigorous engagement with opposing viewpoints. The ".io" domain nods to the contemporary, technological context in which we explore these enduring questions.</p>

            <h3>Summa Contra Gentiles 2.0</h3>
            <p>Aquinas's <em>Summa Contra Gentiles</em> was written to explain and defend the Christian faith using arguments grounded primarily in reason, intended for dialogue with those who did not accept the authority of Christian scripture. This site aims to be a "Summa Contra Gentiles 2.0" – an attempt to apply a similar rigor and rational focus to both timeless philosophical questions and contemporary challenges arising from science, technology, and modern philosophy.</p>

            <h3>Focus on Reason</h3>
            <p>While inspired by the Thomistic tradition, the primary tool employed here is <strong>natural reason</strong>. The goal is to structure arguments and explore questions in a way that appeals to logic, observation, and philosophical principles accessible to anyone, regardless of their faith background. We aim to see how far reason can take us in understanding reality, human nature, and our ultimate purpose. This approach is intentionally chosen to foster dialogue with atheists, agnostics, and seekers of all kinds who prioritize rational inquiry.</p>

            <h3>Structure</h3>
            <p>The questions are organized into sections, moving generally from foundational principles (<em>Fundamenta</em>), through the nature of the human person (<em>De Homine</em>), towards ultimate questions about God and purpose (<em>De Deo et Fine Ultimo</em>). We also include direct engagements with modern philosophers (<em>Disputationes</em>) and occasional less formal thought experiments (<em>Quaestiones Non Seriae</em>).</p>

            <h3>Our Aim</h3>
            <p>This site is an experiment in structured thought and dialogue. Using the clarity of the scholastic method, amplified or explored through the lens of AI-generated dialectics, we seek not necessarily final answers, but deeper understanding, clearer formulation of problems, and a robust exploration of the arguments surrounding life's most important questions. We invite you to join the disputation.</p>
